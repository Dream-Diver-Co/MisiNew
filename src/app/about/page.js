              <p>
                A treatment at MiSi NeuroPsy is built up in different phases. We
                start with the registration. Then there will be an intake
                interview and hopefully we will jointly arrive at a treatment
                plan. Then we will start working on your treatment plan. In the
                meantime, we regularly check whether we are still on the right
                track and work towards completion.
              </p>
              <h3> Quality standards</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                MiSi NeuroPsy works according to the latest scientific standards
                for the applicable professional groups. To guarantee this, MiSi
                employs researchers who have a PhD who monitor the scientific
                standards of MiSi NeuroPsy on a weekly basis and supplement them
                where necessary. For example, the internal library is currently
                being supplemented with a lot of information about
                screen-to-screen and telephone treatment. During the treatment,
                those involved will work with you and think about tailoring the
                treatment as much as possible.
              </p>
              <h3> Registration</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Your registration (via the doctor or our website) is received by
                the registration team who checks and processes it daily. After
                this, your referral will be discussed and assessed within the
                assessment staff. This may result in 1) that you can immediately
                get an intake appointment, 2) that we call you and / or your
                referrer for other information or 3) that we inform you and / or
                your referrer that we are not the right healthcare provider for
                you. Even if the care may not be reimbursed by your health
                insurer, the registration team will indicate this and examine
                the options with you.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                If you are eligible for an intake appointment, the application
                team will contact you within 1 - 3 days to schedule an
                appointment in the same or the following week. You will then be
                sent a questionnaire to map out your complaints, which will be
                discussed with you during the intake interview.
              </p>
              <h3> Intake and diagnosis</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The intake is the first meeting you have with a practitioner.
                During this meeting we discuss what your complaints are and what
                your request for help is. Questionnaires are also used for this.
                This is followed by a treatment plan meeting. This conversation
                may be during your first appointment but more often during your
                second appointment. The practitioner will discuss the diagnosis
                and the treatment options with you. Together with the
                practitioner you choose the form of treatment that suits you
                best. You draw up the treatment plan together with the
                practitioner. At the end of the intake phase, the treatment plan
                is always put in your electronic patient file in agreement with
                you.

                {" "}
                If the intake shows that you need other care, the practitioner
                will discuss the next steps with you. It may also be that
                further diagnostics are required. MiSi NeuroPsy also has its own
                diagnostics team.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                It may happen that after the first consultation our care does
                not suit you or that there is no &apos;click&apos; with the
                practitioner. If it turns out that the treatment offer is not
                appropriate, we will work with you to determine where the best
                care can be provided by our chain partners.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                A good match with the practitioner is very important. At the end
                of the intake phase, the practitioner will ask you whether the
                match is a good one to start the treatment. If there is no click
                with the practitioner, it will be checked whether another
                practitioner from MiSi NeuroPsy is a better match.

              <h3> Treatment plan and treatment</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                A BGGZ treatment consists of 3 to 12 sessions, depending on the
                severity and complexity of your complaints. SGGZ treatment can
                consist of up to 30 sessions. The shortest process is one month,
                the most common process is three months and if necessary your
                process can take a year. Your sessions will be weekly, unless
                otherwise agreed in exceptional cases (once every 2 or 4 weeks).
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In the second meeting we look back at the intake and discuss the
                treatment plan. The treatment plan contains the goals we are
                going to work on and how we are going to do this. The
                practitioner carries out the treatment according to the MiSi
                NeuroPsy treatment plan and care pathways. During the treatment
                you will receive information and assignments that you can use at
                home. MiSi NeuroPsy also uses eHealth modules where you can, for
                example, keep records and diaries, do homework assignments and
                read information in peace. This allows you to continue to work
                on your treatment goals at home.
              </p>
              <h3> Involved environment</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                It is possible to bring a loved one (family, friend) to a
                conversation. Indicate this to your practitioner in advance. You
                can also share all information and your progress with others via
                eHealth.
              </p>
              <h3> Evaluation moments</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                We regularly check how things are going. Are we satisfied with
                the progress? Does the treatment still meet your expectations?
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In any case, at every appointment there are moments when we look
                back and forward with you at the difference in your health.
                These interim evaluations also consider whether the treatment
                needs to be adjusted. At the end of your treatment process, we
                look at your health and you are also asked about your
                satisfaction with the treatment.
              </p>
              <h3> Closure and aftercare</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Your treatment will last as long as necessary and no longer than
                necessary. It is discussed in advance how long the process will
                take according to our estimate. This can be anywhere from three
                to thirty sessions, or a month to twelve months. We will adjust
                this if necessary. We do this during the evaluations.
              </p>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In the treatment at MiSi NeuroPsy, we always work on
                appointments to prevent a relapse. That is why our treatment
                focus is not only towards clinical recovery but also to empower
                you personally, socially and socially. To achieve this, we
                therefore work multi-systemically wherever possible. For
                example, by involving the social support system and if it is not
                available, expand it. But we also work with flash cards, which
                you can fall back on if you just don&apos;t remember. That way
                you can get to work yourself if things don&apos;t go well in the
                future.
              </p>
              <h3> Treatment methods</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                The most common forms of treatment that our therapists can offer
                are:
              </p>
              <h3> CBT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a combination of cognitive
                therapy and behavioral therapy. In cognitive therapy, the
                emphasis is mainly on changing the way you think and interpret.
                Behavioral therapy mainly focuses on changing behavioral
                patterns (which maintain the problems and complaints). The aim
                of this therapy is to learn helpful thinking patterns and thus
                helpful behavioral patterns. We assume that if people change
                their way of thinking and / or acting, then how they feel will
                also change.
              </p>
              <h3> MBCT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Attention-oriented cognitive therapy (MBCT) combines meditation
                techniques with cognitive behavioral therapy. During this
                therapy you learn to allow both positive and negative emotions
                and thoughts and to accept them for what they are. Furthermore,
                attention is paid to dwelling more on the experience in the here
                and now without judging it.
              </p>
              <h3> IPT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a short-term and supportive
                talk therapy designed for the treatment of depressive symptoms.
                The goal of this therapy is to find a (quick) solution to the
                problems someone encounters. These problems are always related
                to recent changes in relationships with (significant) others.
                During the therapy, attention is therefore paid to improving
                relationships with others.
              </p>
              <h3> EMDR</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a
                therapy for people who continue to suffer from the consequences
                of a shocking event, such as an accident or violence. Thinking
                about this traumatic event still evokes unpleasant emotions. The
                use of EMDR treatment reduces the intense emotions associated
                with a post-traumatic stress disorder or other trauma-related
                disorders.
              </p>
              <h3> Schema therapy</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Schema therapy makes it possible to understand and change old
                complicated behavioral patterns. During this therapy, students
                learn to change old behavioral patterns into desired behavior,
                by, among other things, recognizing the old behavior and by
                learning new thoughts.
              </p>
              <h3> MBT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Mentalization-Based Treatment is a proven effective treatment
                for people with emotion regulation problems, hypersensitivity
                and impulsive behavior. In this therapy, attention is paid to
                learning to perceive and understand their own behavior and the
                behavior of others. In addition, they learn to understand the
                feelings, thoughts and intentions of others.
              </p>
              <h3> ACT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Acceptance &amp; Commitment therapy is a form of behavioral
                therapy that teaches how to make room for unpleasant emotions
                (acceptance). In addition, during this form of therapy,
                attention is also paid to distance yourself from negative
                thoughts in a healthy way and to live more in the here and now.
              </p>
              <h3> System therapy</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                In system therapy we assume that the social, relational and
                cultural context always plays a role in the complaints. The most
                important feature of this form of therapy is that important
                loved ones such as the partner, children, brother, sister,
                parents, neighbors, friends or colleagues are involved in the
                therapy. The parties involved are working to map out the mutual
                interaction patterns and to work towards improving them.
              </p>
              <h3> DGT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) focuses on learning to get
                a grip on strong emotions, such as sadness, sadness, anger and
                fear or a change of emotions. During therapy, attention is paid
                to examining these (strong) emotions, understanding them and
                learning to deal with them better.
              </p>
              <h3> EFT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                Emotion-oriented therapy focuses on understanding, experiencing
                and changing emotions. Furthermore, the focus is also on
                becoming aware of underlying emotions and giving them new
                meanings, making behavioral changes possible.
              </p>
              <h3> PDT</h3>
              <p>
                {" "}
                With psychodynamic therapy (PDT) it is possible to gain more
                insight into yourself. During this therapy, attention is paid to
                unconscious thoughts and feelings (for example memories from
                early childhood) that can no longer be consciously remembered,
                but do influence current feelings and behavior.

                <br /> MiSi NeuroPsy can provide basic mental health care
                short-term treatment and / or diagnostics as possible for mild
                or moderate psychological problems. However, if the complaints
                require longer care, it will be determined whether you are
                eligible for specialized mental health care (upscaling). For the
                SGGZ we offer diagnostics and treatment mainly in the field of
                trauma and personality problems, neurocognitive function and
                development disorders and mood problems (uni- and bipolar). The
                remainder is referred to specialized institutions in the region.

                If the care offered at MiSi NeuroPsy is not sufficient or

                  Vascular dementia is a form of dementia that is very common,
                  especially in old age.&nbsp;This form of dementia is caused by
                  problems in the blood circulation in the brain (vascular
                  damage).&nbsp;There is currently no treatment that can cure
                  vascular dementia.&nbsp;However, doctors can treat the causes
                  of vascular damage.&nbsp;This treatment may slow the
                  progression of vascular dementia.&nbsp;Therefore, recognizing
                  vascular damage in patients with memory complaints or dementia
                  is important for proper diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp;

                  MiSi NeuroPsy considers it important to ask the caretaker a
                  number of concrete factors with regard to the treatment
                  immediately after treatment;&nbsp;Consumer quality index
                  Ambulatory care (CQ).&nbsp;The CQ index has been developed to
                  inventory experiences with outpatient mental health care.

                <h3>Complaint procedure</h3>
                <p>
                  The complaints procedure has been documented and established
                  for the year 2023/2024 in accordance with the requirements of
                  the Healthcare Quality, Complaints and Disputes Act
                  (Wkkgz).&nbsp;Patients/clients have the opportunity to express
                  and submit their
                  dissatisfaction/complaints.&nbsp;Patients/clients can of
                  course express their dissatisfaction with the practitioner or
                  coordinating practitioner.&nbsp;In this way, it is easy to
                  mediate and a solution can be sought (possibly with the
                  mediation of the management).
