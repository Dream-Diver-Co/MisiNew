          <h4>Update corona</h4>
          <p>
            There &nbsp;are no more corona measures.&nbsp;But there are advice
            to limit the spread of the corona virus.&nbsp;To prevent
            contamination as much as possible, the basic advice still
            applies.&nbsp;The basic advice is: wash your hands, cough and sneeze
            into your elbow, stay at home if you have complaints and do a test
            and ensure sufficient fresh air.&nbsp;
            <br />
            <br />
            We would like to ask you to adhere to the basic advice at home, on
            the road and at our location.&nbsp;
